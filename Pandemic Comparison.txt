Pandemic Comparison

Our team wants to track and analyze the outbreak of Corona Virus against the 2003 SARS outbreak.

Our analysis will include comparing  confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries of each pandemic by:
    -Geography
    -Date
    -Prevalence Amongst Gender
    -Age

We also want to use the SARS outbreak, if possible, to determine the time to peak spread of the Corona Virus.

In the attached repo we have dropped the API's we plan to use.
